# translateJ
## Description
translateJ is a small library that can be used to return strings in different locales, as specified by a language parameter.
## Requirements
Java compiler/JVM.
## How to Use
Import the class or edit the file directly to get access to its methods. Files will need to be set up that have key and string pairs for each language. Refer to the two example text files provided.

Once that is all done, just instantiate the class and call the readTranslationFile method for each language file being used. When a translated string is needed, call translate(key, language) to return the appropriate string in the lang being used. Refer to the base .java file itself for an example of usage.
## Future Improvements
- Probably none.
